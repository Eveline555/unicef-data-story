# Introduction

Access to healthcare and opportunities for physical activity are essential pillars of human development, especially for children and young people. UNICEF’s global mission includes ensuring the right to health and well-being for every child, yet inequalities continue to persist across regions and demographics. Through this data story, we explore critical global health indicators — healthcare access, physical inactivity rates, gender disparities, and evolving trends — by visualizing and interpreting UNICEF datasets. This journey highlights where progress has been made and where urgent action is still required to create a healthier and more equitable future for all.

# Global Healthcare Access Across Countries

Healthcare access remains one of the cornerstones of public health, influencing life expectancy, child mortality, and the overall well-being of communities. Yet, across the world, the ability to access quality healthcare services varies enormously. By mapping healthcare access percentages across countries, we can identify where progress has been made and where critical gaps persist. Darker shades on the map represent better healthcare access, while lighter shades highlight countries where more investment and policy reforms are urgently needed.

```{python}
# Healthcare Access Choropleth Map (Interactive)
import plotly.express as px

# Filter indicator1 data for 2020
health_map = indicator1[indicator1["Year"] == 2020].dropna(subset=["Healthcare Access (%)"])

fig = px.choropleth(
    health_map,
    locations="Country",
    locationmode="country names",
    color="Healthcare Access (%)",
    color_continuous_scale="Blues",
    title="Healthcare Access by Country (2020)",
    labels={"Healthcare Access (%)": "Access (%)"}
)

# Global Inactivity Levels Across Regions

Physical inactivity is a major public health concern that increases the risk of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. In many low- and middle-income countries, a combination of limited recreational infrastructure, safety concerns, and socioeconomic barriers restricts opportunities for physical activity. This bar chart visualizes physical inactivity rates across countries in 2020, offering a snapshot of global patterns and highlighting regions where interventions and awareness programs are urgently needed to promote active, healthy lifestyles.

# health_df = pl.read_csv("unicef_indicator_1.csv")
# health_2020 = health_df.filter(pl.col("Year") == 2020).to_pandas()
# health_2020 = health_2020.rename(columns={"Healthcare Access (%)": "Healthcare_Access"})

# Physical Inactivity vs Healthcare Access

Exploring the relationship between healthcare access and physical inactivity unveils crucial insights into global health dynamics. Countries with limited healthcare services may struggle to promote preventive health practices, including regular physical activity. The scatter plot below illustrates the correlation between healthcare access and physical inactivity levels in 2020. Observing these patterns allows policymakers to understand the dual importance of both healthcare infrastructure and lifestyle interventions in combating the rise of non-communicable diseases.

```{python}
# Correct Scatter Plot (Google Colab Style)

import plotly.express as px

# 1. Filter for Year = 2015
indicator1_2015 = indicator1[indicator1["Year"] == 2015]
indicator2_2015 = indicator2[indicator2["Year"] == 2015]

# 2. Merge filtered datasets
merged_df = pd.merge(
    indicator1_2015,
    indicator2_2015,
    on="Country",
    how="inner"
)

# 3. Drop missing values
merged_df = merged_df.dropna(subset=["Healthcare Access (%)", "Inactivity (%)"])

# 4. Create scatter plot
fig = px.scatter(
    merged_df,
    x="Healthcare Access (%)",
    y="Inactivity (%)",
    title="Healthcare Access vs Physical Inactivity (2015)",
    color="Inactivity (%)",
    color_continuous_scale="viridis",

        "Inactivity (%)": True
    }
)

    coloraxis_colorbar=dict(title="Physical Inactivity (%)")
)

```
# Time Series of Physical Inactivity Over Time

Tracking physical inactivity over time provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of global health initiatives. By observing trends from 2010 to 2020, we can identify whether efforts to promote active lifestyles are succeeding or if further intervention is necessary. This time-series chart displays the average global inactivity rates over the decade, highlighting whether the world has made meaningful progress towards reducing physical inactivity and encouraging healthier living habits.

```{python}
# Time-Series Line Chart: Global Average Physical Inactivity Over Time
import plotly.express as px

# Prepare data
inactivity_trend = (
    indicator2.dropna(subset=["Inactivity (%)", "Year"])
    .groupby("Year")["Inactivity (%)"]
    .mean()
    .reset_index()
)

fig = px.line(
    inactivity_trend,
    x="Year",
    y="Inactivity (%)",
    markers=True,
    title="Global Average Physical Inactivity Over Time (2010–2020)",
    labels={
        "Year": "Year",
        "Inactivity (%)": "Average Inactivity (%)"
    }
)

fig.show()
```
# Gender Disparities in Physical Inactivity

Gender plays a significant role in physical activity levels across the globe. Social norms, cultural restrictions, and unequal access to recreational spaces often limit the opportunities available for women and girls to participate in physical activities. This donut chart visualizes the average inactivity rates between males and females in 2020. The results emphasize that females consistently report higher inactivity rates compared to males, highlighting the need for gender sensitive interventions that address barriers and promote inclusive physical activity initiatives worldwide.

# Conclusion

This UNICEF data story has highlighted urgent global challenges in healthcare access, physical inactivity, and gender disparities. While progress has been made in many regions, the disparities remain too significant to ignore. Our visual exploration showed that improving healthcare infrastructure and promoting active lifestyles are crucial for enhancing global health outcomes, especially for vulnerable populations such as women and children.

To create a healthier world, collaborative efforts between governments, communities, and international organizations must be prioritized. Investing in healthcare, building safer spaces for physical activity, and promoting gender equity can drive meaningful change.

As UNICEF’s mission reminds us:

> "Children are not only our future — they are our present."  
> Investing in their health today means investing in a more equitable and vibrant tomorrow.

Together, through collective action, we can build a world where everyone, regardless of geography, gender, or income, enjoys fair opportunities for health, happiness, and well-being.
